### AI-Generated Text Must Carry a Disclaimer

Any text (PR description, commit message body, code comments, documentation) that was written
autonomously by an AI Agent **must** be framed with an disclaimer that the text is autonomously generated
by the AI Agent, at both the start and the end of that text block.

## Key Architecture

- **ControlObject/ControlProxy**: `[Group], key_name` inter-component communication.
- **Engine thread**: Real-time audio — no allocations, no locks, may emit Qt signals but cannot receive them.
- **parented_ptr/make_parented**: Qt object-tree ownership. Object must get a parent before `parented_ptr` destructs.
